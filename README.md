# One test!

If you don't have any tests, anything is already better than nothing.

So start with one test.

Check out and choose which one you prefer:

- [unit](/src/App.test.js)
- [e2e](/cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js)

And then start testing one component, one process, one "happy path".

## How to use this

I used `pnpm` here, so you need to have `pnpm` installed globally.

```bash
pnpm install

# unit tests
pnpm test

# e2e tests
pnpm test:cy
```

## Outro

Happy testing!
